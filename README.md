<h1>How to rent a house</h1>
<p>To rent a house, first determine your budget and priorities to find suitable properties using online platforms or agents. Then, view the properties to assess if they meet your needs. Prepare your required documents, such as proof of income and employment, and secure character references. Once you find a home you like, apply for it and be prepared to pay any required fees. Finally, carefully review the tenancy agreement to understand the terms and conditions before signing. </p>
